# NASA Mobile App

## Description
This project involves creating a mobile application that utilizes the NASA image API. The app allows users to search for specific content and displays the results through an intuitive user interface.

## Additional Libraries Used
- **OKHttp**: Used in conjunction with Retrofit to handle API calls efficiently.
- **Retrofit**: Utilized for fetching data from the NASA image API.
- **Picasso**: Used for image processing since Retrofit is not compatible with image handling.

## Architecture
The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern. The implementation is designed to facilitate user searches through a dedicated search feature. The search results populate the model, subsequently updating the view. This approach ensures a clear separation of concerns and promotes maintainability.
